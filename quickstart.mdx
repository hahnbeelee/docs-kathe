  "Daniela Amodei told us Anthropic has always had a culture interview, which
  has been important as it's become a rapidly scaling AI company."

Daniela Amodei, her brother Dario and a set of other colleagues left OpenAI in
2020 because they wanted to build an artificial intelligence company that
developed what they considered to be a safer, more trustworthy model. That is,
culture was never going to be a nice to have at what became Anthropic, it was
going to be essential.

That’s why Daniela, whose experience included leading recruiting and talent
efforts at OpenAI and Stripe before that, implemented a culture fit interview
from the beginning.

Anthropic now finds itself in the middle of AI fervor — it has raised over $7
billion in the last year. Following her onstage appearance at our inaugural
Inflection event for founders in November, Daniela told us that culture
screening is as important as ever in this period of hypergrowth.

Anthropic has its purpose and values clearly articulated on its site, and the
culture fit interview accompanies technical ones because the company wants its
team on the same page (while allowing for disagreement and evolution along the
way). The future of AI is a controversial subject with multiple schools of
thought, but Daniela believes that startups across all industries would benefit
from clarity of values from the beginning and ensure that they’re fundamentally
maintained, whether they have five employees or hundreds.
